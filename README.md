Step 1: Data Cleaning Process
- Check out the Rmarkdown file labeled "Retial-Australian_Grocery_Store_Analysis.rmd"
- This file contains the Rmarkdown code and the the run tgrough of the thought process of the data cleaning that we did using R!

Step 2: Data Visual!
- We selected many questions we were intrested in solving and created visualizations for all of those questions! While many of our questions overlapped
questions that Dubstech had, we were able to learn a lot and practice using our skills learned from the DubsTech workshops to reality!
- Please check our presentation for the more indepth answers to our questions and data visualization charts!

Step 3: Machine Learning Model:
- Using python, we created a machine learning linear regression model that uses the 2018 data to train the model to predict the total sales, total cost, and quantity of items sold for the store and each category for Jan-March of 2019.
- This repo conatins the python code
